<p>RecTheTrail is getting a makeover, internally and externally!</p>

<p>About a month ago, I found that the site was inexplicably down for the count. I'm still not entirely sure what happened, but I decided that given that, it was finally time to implement some of the changes that I had been thinking about for almost two years.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>In short, I've learned so much in the past two years through my professional work and wanted to bring that to RecTheTrail. From backend to UI/UX to machine learning to code quality and readability, I've learnt a ton and would be remiss not to make the necessary updates to this app.</p>

<p>For starters, I've been meaning to <b>pull the app off of AWS and move everything over to Google Cloud.</b> I'd recently become aware of GCP through my current job and now have a strong preference for it over AWS. I never found AWS to be particularly intuitive, whereas GCP was not only more intuitive, but I felt there was a GCP service for every aspect of my app.</p>

<p><b>Code quality also needed a facelift.</b> I learned so much about code quality in my first month at MetaBrite alone, that I was horrified at my code in this project. Along the same lines, git repo structure and best practices for code commitment issues - why didn't I know anything about that at the time. Oh right, because I was learning 10,000 things at once.</p>

<p>On the front end, I knew from the get go that work was eventually going to have to be done on my site. Especially the recommendation landing page. I'm not a UI/UX person or a web developer by training, so I gave myself some passes on some things that I knew were issues initially. But after having to explain how to use the page over and over again to people I was showing it to, I feel that I need to incorporate those changes into this revamp.</p>

<p>Finally, more features will be coming with RecTheTrail 2.0! I want to play around with some of the GCP ML APIs but there should be some features using those and automate hazard warning for hikes that the site recommends.</p>

<p>Its going to be a fair bit of work, so I don't expect that the site will be up again too soon (I am afterall, fully employed with a social life), but I'm hoping to role out the site again by Fall 2018. Until then, happy hiking!</p>
