<h2><a href="http://recthetrail.com/">Rec The Trail</a></h2>
<p>Rec the Trail is a capstone project completed for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program I took during the summer of 2016.</p>

<p>The data was scraped from the Washington Trails Association using requests and BeautifulSoup. All subsequent analyzes were completed in Python using scikit-learn. Recthetrail.com is deployed using flask and AWS.</p>

<p>For more information on individual components of the project, check out the posts below:</p>
