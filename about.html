<h2>Data Science</h2>
<p>I’m a data scientist with a passion for story-telling through data, particularly the unstructured variety. I have three years of experience building biostatistical models in SAS and extensive experience using Python to implement supervised and unsupervised learning models.</p>

<p>As of October 2016, I joined the team at MetaBrite, Inc as a Machine Learning Software Developer.  While a large portion of my time is spent writing machine learning algorithms and tuning models, I also act as the bridge between the machine learning engineers and the software developers.  This role is also giving me the opportunity to learn software development from exceptionally talented and experienced engineers.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2016, a group of 18 other students and myself completed the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program in Seattle, WA.</p>

<h2>Environmental Health</h2>
<p>Prior to my career switch to data science, I worked as an environmental health consultant, building environmental and human health risk assessment models. I have a Masters of Science in Environmental Health from Boston University, with a focus on risk assessment, exposure assessment and biostatistical analysis. Much of my work, both academically and professionally, focused around heavy metal contamination in soil, specifically in the Boston area.</p>

<p>You can find links to publications I coauthored during my consulting work <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Tabony+JA%5BAuthor%5D">here</a>.

 

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Like most other residents of the Pacific Northwest, when not coding, I can usually be found in the mountains.  I’m currently an intermediate alpine climbing student with the Mountaineers and spend lots of my time either rock climbing, hiking or mountaineering.  In 2015, I summited both Mt Baker and Mt Rainier.</p>

<p>In 2014, I had the opportunity to travel to Iran to as part of an International Highlining team, Crossing Lines.  Details of our team and trip can be found <a href="https://www.crossinglines.org/">here</a>.</p>
