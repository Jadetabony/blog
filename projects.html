<p><b>Note as of 8/7/2018: RecTheTrail is down for improvements. See <a href="/blog/2018/08/07/recthetrailupdate.html">this post</a> for details!</b></p>
<p>Rec the Trail is a capstone project completed for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program I took during the summer of 2016.</p>

<p>The data was scraped from the Washington Trails Association using requests and BeautifulSoup. All subsequent analyzes were completed in Python using scikit-learn. Recthetrail.com is deployed using flask and AWS.</p>
